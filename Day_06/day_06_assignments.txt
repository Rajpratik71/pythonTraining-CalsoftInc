	5. Delete student by roll no

1. Run Pylint, flake8 and black on your code and also resolve all errors.
Note: Take screenshots before and after resolving errors.

2. Write unit tests for this using Unittest and Pytest framework.
- Add custom exceptions for verifying inputes.
- Use mocking for requires scenarios.
- Code coverage should be 100%

3. Try running performance analysis tools on your code:
- Traceing, time.time(), timeit, profiling.
Note: Attach screenshots of it.

4. Use Comprehension in your code.

5. Implement Context manager for to create default dict(instead of init) and clear all data.
