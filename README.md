# PDT_2019_Trainers

Repository for trainers to upload their Sample codes and Assignments.
Code Sample
Ensure that all sample code is working code.
Use the prefix 'sample' to the module name.
Try as much as possible to keep samples at atomic levels instead of clubbing multiple things in the same concept.
   Eg. sample_decorator.py, sample_datatypes.py, 
       sample_logger.py, sample_class_inheritance.py etc.
Have proper comments in the sample code.
It would be good if you also add the usage in comments
Treat sample code like a script so that trainees can run them individually.
Use Python 3.x but just make sure that the change required to make it work on 2.x is not a radical big change.
Make sure code samples are appropriately referenced in your presentations.

Assignment
Ensure that majority of your topic gets covered in the assignment
Assignment problems should have a variance in the level of complexity.
    simple, medium, complex
Assignment problems should also include debugging and fixing issues 
    i.e induce a bug/error in your problem code 
We can have a pool of assignments created and at run time we can choose what to share with the trainees.
