- Design the DB schema and models for above requirements and create rest end points
- SQLAlchemy or Peewee ORM can be used
- Use SQLite or MySQL as database or your preferred choice of database
- Wherever required rest endpoints should accept json inputs in post payload(content-type application/json)
- All rest endpoints must returned json output
- Try to use serializers for data serialization
