1) Write a function which will takes a first parameter as *args, newlist as a second parameter. The default value to the newlist  will be "[]".
   Append the args in the list inside the function and print the list.
   call the function as :
   func(1,2,3)
   func(7,8,9, a=[])
   func(8,9,10)
   Explain the observation. 
   PS. Don't copy paste from google, try to undestand what's happening in the background and explain in your own words

2) Make a package with  controller and executor subpackage.
   executor will have a module as the main script to be executed.
   Use the library math and random and write some functions in cotroller package's module. 
   executor package's module will import functions from controller. (Try to be creative with imports and use __init__.py , aliases to make imports more direct.)
   The main script will call these functions when ran with user given inout via console.
