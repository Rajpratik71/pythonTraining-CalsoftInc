1. Check below program, to find a given number is armstrong or not(but not giving correct result).
The task is to debug the existing code to execute it successfully.

******************** PROGRAM START ********************
num = int(input("enter a number: "))
 
length = len(str(num))
sum = 0
temp = num
 
while(temp != 0):
	sum = sum + ((temp % 10) ** length)
	temp = temp / 10
 
if sum == num:
	print("armstrong number")
else:
	print("not armstrong number")

******************** PROGRAM END ********************



2. Write a program to count positive and negative numbers in a list.
Task is to add break point in code to check we are getting correct count for every ieration, also check all debugging commands given in PPT.



3. Write a program that will accept input from user,
X = row, Y = col, serach_value = V
create a X*Y matrix and store numbers in it in order i.e. X+(Y*Y) 
then search the number V in matrix and add break-point in code if cell value is equal to V and finally program will return the number of occurences of V in matrix.
